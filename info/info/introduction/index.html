<p><b>This page will provide instructions about the organisation of the Weekly Artificial Intelligence (WAI) meetings. </b></p>
<p>The goal of the WAI meetings is to foster a friendly environment, in which we inform each other about our research, discuss ideas, and create a sense of community between the research groups. <br>
The WAI meetings are organized by the four Artificial Intelligence research groups of the VU. These are: 
<ul style = "list-style-type:circle;margin:1%">
<li>Knowledge Representation & Reasoning (KRR)</li>
<li>User Centric Data Science (UCDS)</li>
<li>Computational Intelligence (CI)</li>
<li>Social AI</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>They are organized every other Monday (holidays excluded) from 16:00 to 17:00. The meetings are in the FEW building, but the room varies. The room for the specific date can be found both in the <a href = "http://wai.few.vu.nl/schedule">schedule</a> and in the email announcement of the meeting. <br>
Our aim is to have three different research groups present during each session for diversity.</p>

<p>If you have something you wish to share, be it results, literature, or a problem which you can't solve, we encourage you to claim a slot!! <br>
Should you want to organize a thematic session, or present a collaboration with another AI research group, you are also encouraged to do so! <br>
Should your research group welcome a guest for a special occasion, and this guest is willing to give a presentation which would also be of interest to the other research groups, you are also encouraged to claim a slot!</p>

<p>Recently, a <a href = "{% static 'static/WAI_manifesto.docx' %}">manifesto</a> regarding the WAI has been formulated. <br>
The main points of the manifesto are:<p>

<ul style = "list-style-type:circle;margin:1%">
<li>Everyone presents. This includes everyone from the heads of the research groups to PhD. students</li>
<li>Everyone is also expected to attend the WAI meetings, unless there is a good reason not to do so</li>
<li>Both you and your supervisor are responsible for both your active and your passive participation to the WAI</li>
</ul>

<p>Instructions and material for the presenter are provided on the <a href = "http://wai.few.vu.nl/wai/instruction">instruction page</a>.
There you can also find both a digital and a print friendly evaluation form. </p>

<p>Momentarily, the WAI is organized by Luis Silvestrin. He can be reached by emailing the <a href="mailto:wai-organization.few@listserver.vu.nl">WAI organizers</a>.</p>
